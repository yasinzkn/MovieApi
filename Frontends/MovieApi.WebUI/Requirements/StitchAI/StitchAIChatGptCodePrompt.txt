﻿Design a modern, cinematic login page for a movie and TV series streaming and review website.

The theme should feel premium and immersive, inspired by cinema and streaming platforms.
Use a dark mode color palette with deep blacks, dark blues, and subtle red or gold accent colors.

Layout requirements:
- Centered login card with soft rounded corners and a slight glassmorphism effect
- Large cinematic background image (blurred movie theater or film strip aesthetic)
- Platform logo at the top (movie reel or play icon style)
- Welcome headline such as: "Welcome Back to CineVerse" or "Sign in to explore movies & series"
- Email and password input fields with modern icons
- Primary login button with a bold accent color
- "Forgot password?" link
- "Sign up" call-to-action for new users
- Optional social login buttons (Google, Apple) styled minimally

Typography:
- Modern sans-serif font
- Strong hierarchy with a bold headline and clean form labels

UX details:
- Smooth hover and focus animations
- Subtle shadows and depth
- Clean, uncluttered layout suitable for desktop and mobile

The design should feel like a professional streaming platform login page focused on movies, TV series, and user reviews.
